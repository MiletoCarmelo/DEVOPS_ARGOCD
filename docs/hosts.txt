To make this work in your local environment:

Modify your local hosts file:

On Linux/Mac: Edit /etc/hosts
On Windows: Edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Add these lines:

127.0.0.1   dev.quant-cm.com
127.0.0.1   www.quant-cm.com

If you're using a local Kubernetes cluster (like Minikube or Docker Desktop), ensure you have an Ingress Controller installed. For Minikube, you can enable it with:

minikube addons enable ingress

If you're using a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster, you might need to configure your Ingress Controller to handle these domains. This often involves setting up a wildcard DNS record for your fictive domain.
Update your ArgoCD configuration (in the DEVOPS_ARGOCD repository) to reflect these changes if necessary.

After making these changes:

Commit and push the changes to your DEVOPS_DEPLOY_TradingStrategyAnaylsis repository.
Apply the changes to your ArgoCD setup.

With this configuration:

Your dev environment will be accessible at http://dev.quant-cm.com
Your prod environment will be accessible at http://www.quant-cm.com
